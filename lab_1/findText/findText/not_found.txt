Fable brief allegorical narrative, in verse or prose, illustrating a moral 
thesis or satirizing human beings. The characters of a fable are usually 
animals who talk and act like people while retaining their animal traits. 
The oldest known fables are those in the Panchatantra, a collection of 
fables in Sanskrit, and those attributed to the Greek Aesop, perhaps 
the most famous of all fabulists.

Other important writers of fables include Jean de La Fontaine, whose 
fables are noted for their sophistication and wit, the Russian poet 
Ivan Krylov, and the German dramatist and critic Gotthold Lessing, 
who also wrote a critical essay on the fable. In England the tradition 
of the fable was continued in the 17th and 18th cent. by John Dryden and 
John Gay. The use of the fable in the 20th cent. can be seen in James 
Thurber's Fables for Our Time (1940) and in George Orwell's political allegory, Animal Farm (1945).

The American poet Marianne Moore wrote poems quite similar to fables in their 
use of animals and animal traits to comment on human experience; she also published 
an excellent translation of The Fables of La Fontaine (1954).
